  This will allow us to merge the different Makefile targets once test runners
  are converted.

  interfaces (Matt Roper).

- Polish the debug output when test requirements aren't met a bit and inject the
  program name/subtest in dmesg for easier backtrace/oom debugging (Chris).

  enumeration and log output. Should help other people to run the tests in their
  own framework.

- Helpers for runtime pm tests in igt_aux.

Release 1.6 (2014-03-13)
------------------------

- Changes to support Broadwell in the test suite. (Ben, Damien, et al.)

- Updated (now working again!) Android support from Oscar Mateo.

- Test coverage through i-g-t is now officially an integral part of any drm/i915
  feature work and also for bugfixes. For more details see:

  http://blog.ffwll.ch/2013/11/testing-requirements-for-drmi915.html

  (i.e. nomodeset is used)

- New kernel modesetting helper library for simpler testcases (Damien).

- New structure logging support for tests. Message at the WARN level be
  reflected in the piglit result, also included igt_warn_on macros to simplify
  test asserts which should just result in warnings, but not in a test abort.

- Broadwell support for intel_audio_dump (Mengdong Lin).

- API documentation support (Thomas)

Release 1.5 (2013-11-06)
------------------------

- Some polishing of the test infrastructure, for details see:

  display pipe CRC support (Damien).

- Introduction of a proper naming convention for all the testcases, see
  tests/NAMING-CONVENTION.

- As usual tons of new testcases and improvements and bugfixes to existing ones.

- The testsuite framework itself has gained some regression tests which can be
  run at compile-time with "make check".

- New helpers for the drop_cache kernel interface and use drop_caches(RETIRE) to
  really make sure the gpu is idle in testcases (Oscar Mateo).

Release 1.4 (2013-09-16)
------------------------

- Integration of the gen4+ assembler (Damien).

- Start of a new performance analysis tool from Chris Wilson with front-ends for
  both X11 and plain kms. This uses the perf subsystem and the gpu performance
  counter kernel patches from Chris.

- New register dumper quick_dump from Ben, with lots of work from Damien. This
  will superseed intel_reg_dumper for newer platforms (which are not yet
  released) since it will allow us to automatically generate register dumps from
  the internal xml register specifications.

- Tools to access the pletoria of new indirect register access functions on
  newer platforms.

- Framebuffer contents dumper to debug some of the nastier corruption issues.
  The advantage here is that this bypasses any userspace drivers and so avoids
  that the corruptions get magically fixed when taking an X screenshot.

- Tons of new testcases. Including subtests we are now at roughly 450 tests!

- Improvements to the test framework infrastructure. See
  http://blog.ffwll.ch/2013/08/recent-drmi915-testsuite-improvements.html
  for an overview.

  kernel patch which from 3.3 to work on ivb - Ben Widawsky)

Release 1.1 (2011-12-24)
------------------------

Improved testsuite, usable for kernel regression testing!

- standalone regression tests for the DRM (make check)
- microbenchmarks of the DRM for kernel performance regression testing
