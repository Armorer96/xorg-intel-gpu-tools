SYNOPSIS
========

**intel_gpu_top** [*OPTIONS*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

**intel_gpu_top** is a tool to display usage information of an Intel GPU. It
requires root privilege to map the graphics device.

OPTIONS
=======

-s SAMPLES
    Number of samples to acquire per second.

-o FILE
    Collect usage statistics to FILE. If file is "-", run non-interactively
    and output statistics to stdout.

-e COMMAND
    Execute COMMAND to profile, and leave when it is finished. Note that the
    entire command with all parameters should be included as one parameter.

-h
    Show usage notes.

EXAMPLES
========

intel_gpu_top -o "cairo-trace-gvim.log" -s 100 -e "cairo-perf-trace /tmp/gvim"
    Run cairo-perf-trace with /tmp/gvim trace, non-interactively, saving the
    statistics into cairo-trace-gvim.log file, and collecting 100 samples per
    second.

Note that idle units are not displayed, so an entirely idle GPU will only
display the ring status and header.

BUGS
====

Some GPUs report some units as busy when they aren't, such that even when idle
and not hung, it will show up as 100% busy.
